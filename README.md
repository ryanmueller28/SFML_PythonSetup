# SFML_PythonSetup
A visual studio template for SFML with embedded Python included. It is for 32-bit Python and 32-bit SFML currently. 

Main use cases:

If you want to make a 2D game or Graphical Application in C++, but include Python Scripting functionality on Runtime. This Visual Studio template cuts down a lot of the difficult work on the back end of set up.

To get running when you open up a new project:

1. Change all target builds from x86 to x64. 
2. Change from Debug mode to Release mode.

The rest should work as you need it. The base code includes a simple call to an embedded Python console.
